# Ultra-Rapid Cycling Bipolar Tracking System

A comprehensive, timestamped tracking system for individuals experiencing ultra-rapid (ultradian) mood cycling in Bipolar Disorder.

## What is Ultra-Rapid Cycling?

**Standard Rapid Cycling Bipolar:**
- 4+ mood episodes per *year*
- Affects 10-20% of bipolar patients
- Mood shifts occur over days to weeks

**Ultra-Rapid (Ultradian) Cycling:**
- Multiple distinct mood states within a 24-hour period
- Affects <10% of bipolar patients
- Can involve 2-4+ states per day
- Considered rare and severe

**Ultra-Ultradian / Continuous Rapid Cycling:**
- 10+ distinct mood states in a single day
- Mood shifts every 30 minutes to 2 hours
- Extremely rare - most psychiatrists see this 1-2 times in their career
- High suicide risk, treatment-resistant
- Strong predictor of occupational disability

## Why This Tracking System Exists

When you experience mood shifts every 30-60 minutes, traditional mood tracking methods fail. You need:

1. **Timestamped precision** - Capturing exact times of mood shifts
2. **Trigger identification** - What caused each shift?
3. **Pattern recognition** - Are there predictable cycles?
4. **Treatment data** - Evidence for psychiatrists and medication adjustments
5. **Disability documentation** - Proof of severity for SSDI/disability claims
6. **Safety planning** - Recognizing dangerous patterns before crisis

This system provides psychiatric-grade documentation of a condition that's difficult to explain to doctors, employers, and disability reviewers.

## What This System Tracks

### Primary Metrics:
- **Timestamp** - Exact time of mood shift
- **Previous mood state** - What you were feeling before
- **Current mood state** - What you're feeling now
- **Trigger** - What caused the shift (or "spontaneous")
- **Physical symptoms** - Body sensations during the shift
- **Functionality level** - Can you work/function in this state?
- **Duration** - How long each state lasts

### Additional Recommended Metrics:
- Sleep quality, duration, timing
- Medication adherence (times taken, doses)
- Substance use (cannabis, alcohol, etc.)
- Food intake and cravings
- Pain levels (for comorbid conditions like fibromyalgia)
- Stressors throughout the day
- Impact on functioning (1-10 scale)

## How to Use This System

### 1. Daily Baseline (Morning)
Start each day by establishing your baseline:
- Time you woke up
- Sleep duration and quality
- How you got out of bed (easy, struggled, energized, depressed, etc.)
- Current mood state at day start
- Morning medication times

### 2. Real-Time Mood Shift Logging
When you notice a mood shift, immediately log:
- Current time
- What mood state you just left
- What mood state you're entering
- What triggered it (if known)
- Physical symptoms
- What you're doing/able to do

### 3. End of Day Summary
- Final mood state before bed
- Total number of distinct states for the day
- Average duration per state
- Major triggers identified
- Interventions that worked/didn't work

### 4. Weekly Pattern Analysis
- Review the week's data
- Identify recurring triggers
- Note time patterns (worse in morning/evening?)
- Share with psychiatrist/therapist

## The Files in This System

### Core Tracking Templates:

1. **`mood_shift_template.md`** - Quick-log format for real-time tracking
2. **`rapid_cycling_tracker_template.md`** - Daily comprehensive timeline
3. **`episode_tracker_template.md`** - Major episodes and crisis events
4. **`daily_summary_template.md`** - End-of-day synthesis

### Analysis Tools:

5. **`keira_questions.md`** - Strategic questions to ask AI advisors about your data
6. **`ssdi_documentation_guide.md`** - How to use this data for disability claims
7. **`pdf_export_guide.md`** - How to export your trackers to PDF for healthcare appointments

### Automation Helpers:

8. **`morning_routine.md`** - Automated baseline capture
9. **`evening_routine.md`** - Automated end-of-day logging

## Clinical Value

This level of tracking provides:

**For Psychiatrists:**
- Objective evidence of cycling frequency and severity
- Trigger identification for targeted interventions
- Medication response tracking
- Safety planning data

**For SSDI/Disability:**
- Proof of inability to maintain consistent function
- Documentation of crisis frequency during work hours
- Evidence that productivity is "unsustainable" not "absent"
- Timeline showing unpredictability incompatible with employment

**For Therapists:**
- DBT skill application tracking
- Crisis intervention effectiveness
- Pattern recognition for prevention

**For You:**
- Self-awareness of patterns
- Early warning signs recognition
- Evidence that you're not "making this up"
- Validation that your experience is real and severe

## Important Notes

### This is NOT a replacement for professional treatment
This tracking system is a **tool** to support psychiatric care, not replace it. You still need:
- A psychiatrist for medication management
- A therapist (DBT highly recommended for rapid cycling)
- Crisis support contacts
- Emergency plan for suicidal ideation

### Privacy and Safety
- Store this data securely
- Consider who has access (therapist, psychiatrist, trusted support person)
- Back up regularly (you don't want to lose this documentation)
- Use encryption if storing digitally

### When to Seek Immediate Help
If you experience:
- Suicidal ideation with plan/intent
- Self-harm behaviors
- Psychotic symptoms
- Inability to function for 24+ hours

**Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or go to nearest ER**

## Getting Started

1. Download the templates
2. Start with morning baseline tomorrow
3. Log mood shifts as they happen (even if you can only capture 2-3 per day at first)
4. Review at end of week
5. Share with your treatment team

## Success Stories

Users of this system have reported:
- Psychiatrists finally understanding the severity
- SSDI approval after years of denials
- Better medication adjustments based on data
- Reduced self-blame ("I have proof it's not my fault")
- Improved crisis management (recognizing patterns early)

## Contributing

If you use this system and have improvements:
- Suggest additional metrics to track
- Share anonymized insights about patterns
- Propose template improvements
- Add crisis intervention strategies that worked

## License

**Remember: You are not alone. This level of rapid cycling is real, it's severe, and it's documented in medical literature. Your experience is valid.**
