# Ultra-Rapid Cycling Bipolar Tracking System

A comprehensive, timestamped tracking system for individuals experiencing ultra-rapid (ultradian) mood cycling in Bipolar Disorder.

## What is Ultra-Rapid Cycling?

**Standard Rapid Cycling Bipolar:**
- 4+ mood episodes per *year*
- Affects 10-20% of bipolar patients
- Mood shifts occur over days to weeks

**Ultra-Rapid (Ultradian) Cycling:**
- Multiple distinct mood states within a 24-hour period
- Affects <10% of bipolar patients
- Can involve 2-4+ states per day
- Considered rare and severe

**Ultra-Ultradian / Continuous Rapid Cycling:**
- 10+ distinct mood states in a single day
- Mood shifts every 30 minutes to 2 hours
- Extremely rare - most psychiatrists see this 1-2 times in their career
- High suicide risk, treatment-resistant
- Strong predictor of occupational disability

## Why This Tracking System Exists

When you experience mood shifts every 30-60 minutes, traditional mood tracking methods fail. You need:

1. **Timestamped precision** - Capturing exact times of mood shifts
2. **Trigger identification** - What caused each shift?
3. **Pattern recognition** - Are there predictable cycles?
4. **Treatment data** - Evidence for psychiatrists and medication adjustments
5. **Disability documentation** - Proof of severity for SSDI/disability claims
6. **Safety planning** - Recognizing dangerous patterns before crisis

This system provides psychiatric-grade documentation of a condition that's difficult to explain to doctors, employers, and disability reviewers.

## What This System Tracks

### Primary Metrics:
- **Timestamp** - Exact time of mood shift
- **Previous mood state** - What you were feeling before
- **Current mood state** - What you're feeling now
- **Trigger** - What caused the shift (or "spontaneous")
- **Physical symptoms** - Body sensations during the shift
- **Functionality level** - Can you work/function in this state?
- **Duration** - How long each state lasts

### Additional Recommended Metrics:
- Sleep quality, duration, timing
- Medication adherence (times taken, doses)
- Substance use (cannabis, alcohol, etc.)
- Food intake and cravings
- Pain levels (for comorbid conditions like fibromyalgia)
- Stressors throughout the day
- Impact on functioning (1-10 scale)

## How to Use This System

### 1. Daily Baseline (Morning)
Start each day by establishing your baseline:
- Time you woke up
- Sleep duration and quality
- How you got out of bed (easy, struggled, energized, depressed, etc.)
- Current mood state at day start
- Morning medication times

### 2. Real-Time Mood Shift Logging
When you notice a mood shift, immediately log:
- Current time
- What mood state you just left
- What mood state you're entering
- What triggered it (if known)
- Physical symptoms
- What you're doing/able to do

### 3. End of Day Summary
- Final mood state before bed
- Total number of distinct states for the day
- Average duration per state
- Major triggers identified
- Interventions that worked/didn't work

### 4. Weekly Pattern Analysis
- Review the week's data
- Identify recurring triggers
- Note time patterns (worse in morning/evening?)
- Share with psychiatrist/therapist

## The Files in This System

3. **`rapid_cycling_tracker_template.md`** - Daily comprehensive timeline
4. **`episode_tracker_template.md`** - Major episodes and crisis events
5. **`daily_summary_template.md`** - End-of-day synthesis

### Analysis Tools:

5. **`keira_questions.md`** - Strategic questions to ask AI advisors about your data
6. **`ssdi_documentation_guide.md`** - How to use this data for disability claims
7. **`pdf_export_guide.md`** - How to export your trackers to PDF for healthcare appointments

### DBT Integration:

### Automation Helpers:

10. **`morning_routine.md`** - Automated baseline capture
11. **`evening_routine.md`** - Automated end-of-day logging

## Clinical Value

This level of tracking provides:

**For Psychiatrists:**
- Objective evidence of cycling frequency and severity
- Trigger identification for targeted interventions
- Medication response tracking
- Safety planning data

**For SSDI/Disability:**
- Proof of inability to maintain consistent function
- Documentation of crisis frequency during work hours
- Evidence that productivity is "unsustainable" not "absent"
- Timeline showing unpredictability incompatible with employment

**For Therapists:**
- DBT skill application tracking
- Crisis intervention effectiveness
- Pattern recognition for prevention
- Conversational DBT diary card alternative (for clients with form anxiety)

**For You:**
- Self-awareness of patterns
- Early warning signs recognition
- Evidence that you're not "making this up"
- Validation that your experience is real and severe

## Important Notes

### This is NOT a replacement for professional treatment
This tracking system is a **tool** to support psychiatric care, not replace it. You still need:
- A psychiatrist for medication management
- A therapist (DBT highly recommended for rapid cycling)
- Crisis support contacts
- Emergency plan for suicidal ideation

### Privacy and Safety
- Store this data securely
- Consider who has access (therapist, psychiatrist, trusted support person)
- Back up regularly (you don't want to lose this documentation)
- Use encryption if storing digitally

### When to Seek Immediate Help
If you experience:
- Suicidal ideation with plan/intent
- Self-harm behaviors
- Psychotic symptoms
- Inability to function for 24+ hours

**Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or go to nearest ER**

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Use with AI Assistant (Recommended)

1. Download: `git clone https://github.com/Mamangel/SanctumTools.git`
2. Tell your AI: "Read AI_ASSISTANT_SETUP_GUIDE.md and set yourself up"
3. Say "good morning" to your AI tomorrow
4. Your AI will guide you through everything else

### Option 2: Manual Tracking

1. Download the templates
2. Start with morning baseline tomorrow
3. Log mood shifts as they happen
4. Review at end of week
5. Share with your treatment team

## Success Stories

Users of this system have reported:
- Psychiatrists finally understanding the severity

- Reduced self-blame ("I have proof it's not my fault")
- Improved crisis management (recognizing patterns early)

## Contributing

If you use this system and have improvements:
- Suggest additional metrics to track
- Share anonymized insights about patterns
- Propose template improvements
- Add crisis intervention strategies that worked

## License

**Remember: You are not alone. This level of rapid cycling is real, it's severe, and it's documented in medical literature. Your experience is valid.**
