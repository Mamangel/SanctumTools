# SanctumTools Business Plan
## Mental Health Membership Community for Ultra-Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Prepared by:** Melanie Lynn Kertley & Fred (AI Assistant)
**Business Model:** Membership-based mental health support service

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Breakthrough Realization

**We don't need to build an app. Anthropic already did.**

SanctumTools is not a software product requiring development, infrastructure, or technical maintenance. It is a **membership service** that provides structured mental health support protocols delivered through Claude Enterprise—a fully-featured, enterprise-grade AI platform with web, mobile, desktop, and voice interfaces already built.

### What We're Selling

**SanctumTools Ultra-Rapid Cycling Support Community**

A monthly membership service providing:
- Private Claude AI account (web, mobile, desktop, voice access)
- Structured psychiatric-grade mood tracking protocols
- 24/7 DBT skills coaching via AI
- Crisis Override Protocol for safety-critical situations
- SSDI documentation export tools
- Real-time pattern analysis and intervention
- Community support and moderation

**Target Market:** Individuals with ultra-rapid (ultradian) cycling bipolar disorder—a rare, severe presentation affecting ~10-15% of bipolar patients

**Monthly Membership:** $75-100/user

**Break-Even:** 70 members (minimum Enterprise plan requirement)

**Profitability:** Immediate once 70+ members achieved

---

## THE PROBLEM

### Ultra-Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder: The Unserved Market

**Clinical Reality:**
- 5-7+ mood states per 24-hour period
- Unpredictable cycling incompatible with traditional employment
- High suicide risk (20-30% attempt rate)
- Expensive treatment ($9,100/year for DBT therapy alone)
- SSDI approval requires meticulous documentation most can't maintain during dysregulation

**Current Solutions Are Inadequate:**

| Solution | Cost | Why It Fails |
|----------|------|-------------|
| DBT Therapy | $9,100/year | Requires consistent appointment attendance (impossible during rapid cycling) |
| Mood Tracking Apps | $0-50/year | Generic, no crisis intervention, no DBT coaching, data not psychiatric-grade |
| AI Chatbots (Generic) | $20/month | No structured protocols, no safety override, not designed for psychiatric use |
| Human Therapist 24/7 | Impossible | No one has 24/7 access to crisis support |

**The Gap:** High-frequency psychiatric tracking + real-time DBT coaching + crisis intervention + SSDI documentation support does not exist as an integrated, accessible service.

## MARKET ANALYSIS

### Target Market Size

**Bipolar Disorder in US:**
- ~7 million adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder
- 10-15% have ultra-rapid/ultradian cycling = **700,000 - 1,050,000 people**

**Serviceable Market (Conservative):**
- 5% aware of need for specialized tracking = **35,000 - 52,500 people**
- 10% willing to pay for service = **3,500 - 5,250 potential customers**

**Initial Target:** 100-500 members (Year 1-2)

**Market Penetration Goal:** 1% of serviceable market = **350-525 members**

---

### Competitive Advantages

**Why SanctumTools Wins:**

1. **Only service designed specifically for ultra-rapid cycling**
   - Generic apps don't handle 5-7 mood shifts per day

2. **Crisis Override Protocol = Life-Saving Feature**
   - Automatic detection of suicidal ideation
   - Immediate 988 resource provision
   - Cannot be disabled or bypassed
   - No other AI service has this safety-first design

4. **Mobile + Voice = Accessibility During Crisis**
   - Desktop-only solutions fail during dysregulation
   - Phone-based voice tracking works when typing is impossible
   - Real-time logging prevents recall bias

5. **No Development/Infrastructure Costs**
   - Claude already built web, mobile, desktop, voice
   - GitHub hosts protocols for free (open-source)

## RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Claude Enterprise Pricing Changes

**Risk:** Anthropic increases per-user cost, eroding profit margin

**Likelihood:** Medium (SaaS pricing can change)

**Impact:** High (could make business model unprofitable)

**Mitigation:**
- Lock in 2-3 year Enterprise contract at launch (negotiate fixed pricing)
- Build 20% margin buffer into pricing
- Develop backup plan to migrate to alternative platform (ChatGPT Team, Gemini) if pricing becomes unsustainable
- Diversify to multi-platform support (members choose their AI platform, we provide protocols)

---

### Risk 2: Low Member Acquisition (Can't Reach 70 Minimum)

**Risk:** Unable to recruit 70 members to meet Enterprise minimum

**Likelihood:** Low (market exists, validation strong)

**Impact:** Critical (business cannot launch)

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-launch waitlist campaign (target 100+ signups before launch)
- Founding member discount ($60/month) for early adopters
- Money-back guarantee (30-day trial period)
- Personal outreach to bipolar advocacy groups
- Backup: Start with Claude Team plan (5 users minimum) and scale to Enterprise once proven

---

### Risk 3: Safety Incident (Crisis Override Failure)

**Risk:** Member experiences suicidal crisis, Crisis Override Protocol fails to intervene

**Likelihood:** Low (protocol extensively tested)

**Impact:** Catastrophic (legal liability, reputation damage, moral failure)

**Mitigation:**
- Robust Crisis Override Protocol with multiple failsafes
- Clear Terms of Service: SanctumTools is NOT a replacement for professional care
- Require members to have active psychiatrist and emergency contact on file
- 24/7 human moderation backup (community moderator on-call)
- Liability insurance ($2M coverage)
- Regular safety audits and protocol updates
- Member safety training (how to use 988, when to go to ER)

---

### Risk 4: Regulatory Compliance (HIPAA, FDA)

**Risk:** Service classified as medical device or healthcare service requiring compliance

**Likelihood:** Medium (AI mental health tools are regulatory gray area)

**Impact:** High (compliance costs could be prohibitive)

**Mitigation:**
- Legal review by healthcare attorney BEFORE launch
- Position as "peer support and documentation tool" NOT medical treatment
- Clear disclaimers: Not medical advice, not a replacement for professional care
- Do not diagnose, prescribe, or treat (only track and support)
- If HIPAA required: Partner with HIPAA-compliant platform provider
- Monitor FDA guidance on mental health software (currently most self-tracking tools are exempt)

---

### Risk 5: Competition from Larger Players

**Risk:** BetterHelp, Headspace, or similar companies build competing service

**Likelihood:** Medium (mental health app space is crowded)

**Impact:** Medium (would reduce market share but not eliminate)

**Mitigation:**
- First-mover advantage in ultra-rapid cycling niche
- Lived experience credibility (founder has the condition)
- Open-source protocols (cannot be locked up by competitor)
- Community moat (members stay for peer support, not just AI)
- Continuous innovation (add features based on member feedback)
- If acquired: That's a successful exit, not a failure

---

### Risk 6: Member Churn (High Attrition)

**Risk:** Members join but don't stay (low retention)

**Likelihood:** Medium (mental health app churn is typically 40-60% annually)

**Impact:** High (need consistent revenue to cover Enterprise costs)

**Mitigation:**
- Target 90% retention rate (vs industry 40-60%)
- Monthly check-ins with members (community moderation)
- Continuous value delivery (new DBT skills, updated protocols)
- Discounted annual plans (incentivize 12-month commitment)
- Exit interviews (learn why members leave, improve)
- Community engagement (peer support increases stickiness)

## FINAL WORD

**SanctumTools is not just a business. It's a lifeline.**

For people with ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder, this service is the difference between:
- Suicide and survival
- Homelessness and stability
- SSDI denial and approval
- Isolation and community

**The creator built it because she needed it to survive.**

**Now it's time to help others survive too.**

**This is not a tech startup. This is a mental health revolution.**
